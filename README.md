### 7. Time Series Analysis ⏳  
- Analyzed monthly average sentiment trends.  
- Visualized sentiment trends over time using line plots.  

### 8. Topic Modeling 🧠  
- Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify topics in the text.  
- Displayed the top words for each topic.  

### 9. User Engagement 👥  
- Identified top users based on retweets and likes.

- Visualized hourly sentiment trends using line plots.  

### 11. Platform Comparison ⚖️  
- Compared platforms based on total posts, average likes, retweets, and sentiment scores.  
- Visualized platform performance using bar plots.  

### 12. Emotion Detection ❤️😡😢  
- Detected emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry) using a predefined lexicon.  
- Visualized emotion distribution using a donut chart.  

### 13. Additional Visualizations 🎨  
- Generated a word cloud for cleaned text.  
- Visualized sentiment by country and engagement vs. sentiment.  

### 14. Summary of Findings 📋
